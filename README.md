# Elm UI Patterns

This repository collects a number of UI and application patterns I've discovered while building
Elm applications. These patterns are things that -- to my mind -- are simple/straightforward
in JavaScript but may not have immediately obvious solutions in Elm.

Pull requests containing improvements and new examples would be most appreciated.
