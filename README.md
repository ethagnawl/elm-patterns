# Elm UI Patterns

This repository collects a number of UI patterns I've discovered while building
Elm applications.

I'm still fairly new to Elm, so these patterns are not necessarily the best
approach to any given problem. Pull requests containing improvements and new
examples would be most appreciated.

## TODO
- wait for css transition before state change
- normalize user input data without manipulating form value
- google analytics
